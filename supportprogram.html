                    Navigating between different support programs on offer can be challenging for entrepreneurs
                    and assigning each entrepreneur to the right program can be difficult for the advisors.

                <p>
                    Collaboration between programs should be organized in a structured support flow that connects the dots between what will be the right program,
                    workshop, course or incubator for each entrepreneur.
